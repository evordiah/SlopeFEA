1.	Ensure that the msys packages MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) and
	git are installed on your system. The latest versions are available
	at:
	
	MinGW:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
		Download and run mingw-get-inst-(V#).exe
		where (V#) is the version number. For the latest version select
		'Download latest repository catalogues' in the install wizard.
		The script to start the shell is located at:
		C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat
		
	msysgit:
	https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git
		Download and run the latest installer. If you would like the
		git commands to be available in the MinGW shell (so that a
		separate Git Bash shell is not necessary), select 'Run Git from
		the Windows Command Prompt' in the installer.
		
2.	Open the MinGW shell and define ROOT and PROJECT paths as well as
	the type of operating system. For example, if your root drive is
	labelled 'C:\' and you would like the project to reside in the root
	directory:
	
	$ ROOT=/c
	$ PROJECT=$ROOT
	
	(For 32-bit systems):	$ SYS=x86
	(For 64-bit systems):	$ SYS=x64
	
3.	Change to the project directory:
	
	$ cd $PROJECT
	
4.	Ensure that previous versions of SlopeFEA are not in this directory:

	$ rm -rf SlopeFEA
	
5.	Clone the latest version of the SlopeFEA repository (note this may
	take a few minutes to download):

	$ git clone https://github.com/karcheba/SlopeFEA.git
	
6.	Ensure old versions of LAPACK and BLAS libraries are removed:

	$ cd $ROOT/MinGW/lib
	$ rm -f *blas* *lapack* *tmglib*
	
7.	Copy updated versions of LAPACK and BLAS libraries from the SlopeFEA
	project into your MinGW lib folder:
	
	$ cd $PROJECT/SlopeFEA/LAPACK/$SYS
	$ cp *.a $ROOT/MinGW/lib
	
8.	Compile the analysis code (note that the 'engine' directory contains
	an example Makefile that contains useful commands and shortcuts):
	
	$ cd $PROJECT/SlopeFEA/SlopeFEA/Slope/engine
	$ make
	
9.	Open the SlopeFEA project in Microsoft Visual Studio. To do this,
	navigate to $PROJECT/SlopeFEA/SlopeFEA using Windows Explorer. Now
	double-click on 'SlopeFEA.sln'.
	
10.	Build the project. To do this, in MS Visual Studio, right-click on
	'SlopeFEA' and click 'Build'.
	
11.	Ensure that analysis code resides in the program folder. Using the
	MinGW shell:
	
	$ cd $PROJECT/SlopeFEA/SlopeFEA/Slope/engine
	$ cp *.dll ../bin/Debug
	
12.	Test that the program works properly:
		a.	In MS Visual Studio, push the 'Play' button to run the
			shell.
		b.	Click the 'Open' button in the shell.
		c.	Navigate to the $PROJECT/SlopeFEA/TestFiles directory.
		d.	Select the 'simple.slp' test file.
		f.	Generate the mesh:		'Analyze > Generate Mesh'
		g.	Run the analysis code:	'Analyze > Run Analysis'
		h.	View the output:		'Output > Plot Results'
		i.	Verify that the deformation mode and SYY stress field are
			consistent with simple normal compressive stress in the Y
			direction and no horizontal or shear stress.
		e.	Repeat steps b-i for the 'testCup.slp' test file. The
			problem represents staged construction of an embankment
			by cutting in three lifts.
