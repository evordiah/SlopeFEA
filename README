DESCRIPTION:

This project includes a set of specialized tools for numerical analysis
of problems in geotechnical engineering. The project began in the summer
of 2009 as a Matlab package for conducting slip circle analysis of slopes
consisting of horizontally layered material using Bishop's method [1],
the Rigid Finite Element Method (RFEM) [2], and both binary and continuous
parameter Genetic Algorithm minimization schemes [3,4,5]. Selected results
were presented at the 3rd Canadian Young Geotechnical Engineering &
Geoscientists Conference (cYGEGC) and a conference paper has also been
accepted to the 2011 Pan-Am CGS Geotechnical Conference [6].

During the summer of 2010 a graphical front-end for the project was initially
built using C++ and the Windows API. The GUI advanced the data input
capabilities of the project since it allowed more complex layering and
ground surface configurations to be drawn. During the fall and winter of
2010-2011 the project was rebuilt in C# making use of Microsoft's .NET
Framework v4 to simplify and enrich development of the user interface.

As of May 2011 the project continues to be developed for the purpose of
conducting numerical analysis as part of the author's M.A.Sc. thesis. Recent
additions are structured mesh generation tools for 4-noded quadrilateral and
3-noded triangular elements. Also included in these pre-processors are graphical
input of kinematic boundary conditions and natural boundary conditions (tractions).
Once these tools are complete, the main line of development will be the FEA
engine for analyzing the problems defined by the user input and generated mesh.
This component will be written in Fortran 90/95 and will be added to the
repository as it becomes available. Also planned for the near future of the
project are plotting tools for viewing the FEA output.

Note that this project is being developed primarily for the author's research
purposes and is not intended for community development. However, if you are
interested in further information about the project please contact the author
(see contact info above). For detailed information on the project's development
see the revision history below.
