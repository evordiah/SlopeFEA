DESCRIPTION:

This project includes a set of specialized tools for numerical analysis
of problems in geotechnical engineering. The project began in the summer
of 2009 as a Matlab package for conducting slip circle analysis of slopes
consisting of horizontally layered material using Bishop's method [1],
the Rigid Finite Element Method (RFEM) [2], and both binary and continuous
parameter Genetic Algorithm minimization schemes [3,4,5]. Selected results
were presented at the 3rd Canadian Young Geotechnical Engineering &
Geoscientists Conference (cYGEGC) and a conference paper has also been
accepted to the 2011 Pan-Am CGS Geotechnical Conference [6].

During the summer of 2010 a graphical front-end for the project was initially
built using C++ and the Windows API. The GUI advanced the data input
capabilities of the project since it allowed more complex layering and
ground surface configurations to be drawn. During the fall and winter of
2010-2011 the project was rebuilt in C# making use of Microsoft's .NET
Framework v4 to simplify and enrich development of the user interface.

As of May 2011 the project continues to be developed for the purpose of
conducting numerical analysis as part of the author's M.A.Sc. thesis. Recent
additions are structured mesh generation tools for 4-noded quadrilateral and
3-noded triangular elements. Also included in these pre-processors are graphical
input of kinematic boundary conditions and natural boundary conditions (tractions).
Once these tools are complete, the main line of development will be the FEA
engine for analyzing the problems defined by the user input and generated mesh.
This component will be written in Fortran 90/95 and will be added to the
repository as it becomes available. Also planned for the near future of the
project are plotting tools for viewing the FEA output.

Note that this project is being developed primarily for the author's research
purposes and is not intended for community development. However, if you are
interested in further information about the project please contact the author
(see contact info above). For detailed information on the project's development

REVISION HISTORY:

[29 May 2011]

{Project initialization}
+++ Added project to git://github.com/karcheba/SlopeFEA.git

{v1.0.0.0}
+++ Added .gitignore file to ignore bin/ and obj/ directories

{v1.0.0.1}
+++ (CanvasData.cs) Added LoadX and LoadY modes to DrawModes enum
+++ (LoadX.ico) Created
+++ (LoadY.ico) Created
+++ (LoadX.cur) Created
+++ (LoadY.cur) Created
+++ (MainWindow.xaml) Added LoadX.cur and LoadY.cur as resources
+++ (MainWindow.xaml) Added Horizontal Load and Vertical Load MenuItems

+++ (MainWindow.xaml.cs) Added loadX_Click() and loadY_Click()
+++ (SlopeCanvas.cs) Added LoadX and LoadY cases to OnMouseUp() [for switching cursor on middle mouse button pan]
=== (SlopeCanvas.cs) Changed DrawMode if statement series to equivalent switch-case in OnMouseLeftButtonUp(); this required duplicating one section of code (since C# does not allow "fall-through"), but the value of DrawMode need only be checked once as opposed to 10+ times
+++ (SlopeCanvas.cs) Added List<DrawingPoint> loadPoints and its associated initialization in the constructor
+++ (SlopeCanvas.cs) Added DrawModes.LoadX and DrawModes.LoadY cases to OnMouseLeftButtonUp()
+++ (CanvasData.cs) Added LineLoad class 
+++ (CanvasData.cs) Added LoadX() and LoadY() methods to MaterialBlock class


[30 May 2011]

{v1.0.0.2}
+++ (SlopeCanvas.cs) Added List<feSubstructs> FEASubstructs property and its associated initialization
+++ (MeshGen.cs) Added side effect of setting canvas.FEASubstructs to the generated list of substructures
+++ (FEA.cs) Added Parent property to fe4NodedQuadElement and fe3NodedTriElement to make these objects aware of their parent substructure
=== (MeshGen.cs) Modified calls to fe4NodedQuadElement() and fe3NodedTriElement() to include substruct as parent
+++ (MeshGen.cs) Added elimination of elements with centroid outside substructure in MeshGenStructured3NodedTri()
+++ (MeshGen.cs) Added element renumbering post-elimination in MeshGenStructured3NodedTri()
